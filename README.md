# Textlint Plugin LaTeX2Îµ

This plugin contains rough LaTeX parser which doesn't cover all syntax, but it's enough.

We welcome your contribution for adding new syntax! Thanks.

## Known Issue

This kind of syntax cannot be interpreted correctly.

```latex
\newenvironment{A}
{\begin{B}}
{\end{B}}
```

To avoid this issue, you can write them out of the file with `\input` command.
