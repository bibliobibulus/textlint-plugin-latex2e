# Textlint Plugin LaTeX2Îµ
[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40ta2gch%2Ftextlint-plugin-latex2e.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40ta2gch%2Ftextlint-plugin-latex2e)

This plugin contains rough LaTeX parser which doesn't cover all syntax, but it's enough.

We welcome your contribution for adding new syntax! Thanks.

## Installation

```
$ npm install @ta2gch/textlint-plugin-latex2e
```

And add to `.textlintrc`

```
   plugins: ["@ta2gch/textlint-plugin-latex2e"]
```

## Known Issue

This kind of syntax cannot be interpreted correctly.

```latex
\newenvironment{A}
{\begin{B}}
{\end{B}}
```

To avoid this issue, you can write them out of the file with `\input` command.
